# Changelog

A brief, human-readable summary of each release — highlights and **breaking
changes** — with a pointer to the full diff for detail. Append-only: add entries
under `## [Unreleased]`, rename to the version (e.g. `## [0.24.0]`) at release.
`hamr ai upgrade` already carries the full code diff between versions; this is
the TL;DR on top of it.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-06-17

Whole-repo code-review remediation across the libraries, dev server, Stripe/mail
mocks, TUI, and CLI. Full diff:
[`v0.23.2...v0.24.0`](https://github.com/FyrmForge/hamr/compare/v0.23.2...v0.24.0).

### ⚠️ Breaking

- **CORS denies by default** when `AllowOrigins` is empty (was Echo's `*`) —
  pass explicit origins if you mount it.
- **`validate.URL` accepts only `http`/`https`** — other schemes now fail.
- **Client IP behind a proxy**: set `WithTrustedProxies` / `TRUSTED_PROXIES` to
  your proxy's CIDR, or `RealIP()` (rate-limit key + audit IP) returns the proxy
  IP. Never `0.0.0.0/0`. See `docs/guide/pkg/server.md`.

### Highlights

- **Security**: trusted-proxy IP extraction (XFF no longer blindly trusted),
  audit-log redaction, CSRF cookie flags, argon2 version check, media size
  bounds + category-scoped serving (S3 backend faults now return `500`, not a
  misleading `404`).
- **Dev server**: fixed quit/shutdown hangs, process-reaping and
  scheduler/port-walk/watcher races, proxy response truncation.
- **Stripe/mail mocks**: concurrency-safe (clone-on-read) and higher fidelity
  (checkout PI+Charge, manual capture, accurate decline/resend).
- **TUI & CLI**: rendering fixes (search/selection/bars/modals/unicode);
  `rename`, `upgrade`, and `localegen` hardening.
